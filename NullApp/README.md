# SrtPlayer

An Android SRT test player powered by [ExoPayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer). Most of this code
comes from [YoussefHenna](https://github.com/YoussefHenna) reply in
the [SRT support ExoPayer issue](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8647).

It demonstrates how to use [srtdroid](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/srtdroid) and read data from a
remote SRT device.

It is only a demo project, it is not recommend to use it in production.

## Test

In order to test SrtPlayer, I had 2 tools running:

```bash
srt-live-transmit srt://:1234 srt://:9998 -
```

and

```bash
ffmpeg -f lavfi -re -i smptebars=duration=300:size=1280x720:rate=30 -f lavfi -re -i sine=frequency=1000:duration=60:sample_rate=44100 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -b:v 1000k -g 30 -keyint_min 40 -profile:v baseline -preset veryfast -f mpegts "srt://127.0.0.1:1234?pkt_size=1316"
```

Then press play on the video player.
